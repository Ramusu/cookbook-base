## Memorising Long Theory

The best advice for memorising long form theory found in textbooks or written down during lectures.
A lot of people simply "bang their head against the wall" when it comes to memorising such informations, usually by re-reading the text over and over until they consider it done.
If you want you may stick to that, however there can be slight improvements to this method.
For example, you may try reading the whole thing once and then trying to memorise short fragments. Having memorised one, you move on to the next, only that you also try to recall the previously read info.
Another strategy is going to sleep or a short nap just after studying, as it was proven that sleep helps in moving information into "deep memory".
Finally, explaining/reciting the text to someone else might be worth a try for you.
